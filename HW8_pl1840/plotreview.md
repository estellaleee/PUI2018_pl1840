Assignment 1

I created a plot for 311 calls complainted on residential noisy to see within 2014 to 2018, which few months has the most complaint about the Loud Music/Party.

## Review:

I believe it is an excellent plot which clearly commuincates the spread of the party complains (and occurrences by inference) across years and months. The cluster of high occurence in summer months and low in winter is obvious. The plot is properly labbled and contians the color map. 
There is one suggestion which might improve the plot. It can be seen that most data points are above 15000 (shades of blue), but for november and decmber the data is incmplete and they have very low values. When the data is color coded using the gradiant/heatmap techique these extreme outliers can push the whole data to one edge of the color spectrum. If these two outlier values are excluded, the contrast between the colors of different values will be more visible.
