1. Hypothesis formulation
- The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are constructed properly. 
- The corresponding formulas are listed clearly and correctly.
- The significance level is stated. 

2. Data assessment
- The data needed for this hypothesis test includes only usetype. 
- Using count method, to estimate whether annual subscriber using citibike more often than short-term customer.

3. Statistical test suggestion
- I would suggest using z-test to test H0. Since we know the population parameters, and we want to estimate if these is a difference between proportion in 2 samples (short-term customers vs. annual subscribers). Also, the population N is large enough(larger than 30), so z-test is the most appropriate test.

4. Further suggestion
- We can adding tripduration as our second variables.  By combining these two variables(usertype and tripduration), we can see the total biking time of these two types of users. And the null hypothesis might be slightly different: the proportion of total biking time taken by short-term customers is less than or equal to the proportion of total biking time taken by annual subscibers. Since although annual subscriber using citibike more often, the time they biking might be less than short-term customer. For example, subscribers might using citibike for commuting purpose, and usually this kind of rides wonâ€™t takes too long. But short-term customer might be traveller, and they rides across the city to do sightseeing, in this case, the travel time is usually longer than subscribers. This is just my random thought, we still need data and statistical test to verify.
